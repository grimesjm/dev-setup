# Instructions

Clone and run `./install.sh`

## Warnings

My name is in the gitconfig fix for yourself
`bin/macos/sane-defaults.sh` is pretty invasive, glance over it before it runs!

## OSX Stuff - /bin/macos

Contains a bunch of sane defaults that require a reboot, brew file, etc

## VSCode

settings, extensions, a simple backup script for them

## TODO:
* Parameterize gitconfig at some point
* GIT_SSH_COMMAND should be removed
* Restructure everything to match some of the templates out there
